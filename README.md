Project Summary: Portfolio for myself including 4 tabs, one about me, one projects, one skills/resume, one for contact

No team members

Requirements and how they're fulfilled:

HTML pages: At least 3 HTML pages or a dynamic SPA-style interface
- 4 pages

CSS Styling: Consistent and responsive design using Flexbox and/or media queries
- 250+ lines of styling in style.css, about 120 more than previous portfolio

JavaScript:
Event handling
- Listener and handling for submit button on contact tab and listener for dark/christmas mode buttons

DOM manipulation
- Changing stuff through functions/etc through christmas/dark mode button

Dynamic content updates
- Same thing, content updates with christmas/dark mode button

A functional HTML form with JS validation
- Contact section that prints out email at bottom, has required validations but doesn't email me yet (spent way too much time on this project figuring stuff out and didn't have time)

Data usage with JSON and/or localStorage
- Using local storage to keep dark/christmas mode on when switching between tabs

A working navigation system (links or menu)
- Header bar with navigation buttons
